# Another Falling Sand Sim
## Another falling pixel simulation written in C++ with SDL2 & Box2D

This project aims to create a falling pixel simulation alongside a rigidbody physics simulation of grouped pixels using Box2D.

## Controls
- Up & down arrow keys to change elements.
- Left Mouse Button to place elements.
- Right Mouse Button to erase elements.

## Note
This is still in very early development, was created for learning, and is not intended to represent a finished product.
