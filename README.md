This project aims to create a falling pixel simulation alongside a rigidbody physics simulation of grouped pixels using Box2D.

## Controls

- Left Mouse Button to place elements.
- Right Mouse Button to remove.

## Note
This is still in very early development, was created for learning, and is not intended to represent a finished product.
